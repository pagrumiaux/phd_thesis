	title = {Analyse de scène sonore multi-capteurs : un front-end temps-réel pour la manipulation de scène},
	abstract = {La thèse s’inscrit dans un contexte d’essor de l’audio spatialisé (5.1, Dolby Atmos...). Parmi les formats audio 3D existants, l’ambisonie permet une représentation spatiale homogène du champ sonore et se prête naturellement à des manipulations : rotations, distorsion du champ sonore. L’objectif de cette thèse est de fournir un outil d’analyse et de manipulation de contenus audio (essentiellement vocaux) au format ambisonique. Un fonctionnement temps-réel et en conditions acoustiques réelles sont les principales contraintes à respecter. L’algorithme mis au point est basé sur une analyse en composantes indépendantes (ACI) appliquée trame à trame qui permet de décomposer le champ acoustique en un ensemble de contributions, correspondant à des sources (champ direct) ou à de la réverbération. Une étape de classification bayésienne, appliquée aux composantes extraites, permet alors l’identification et le dénombrement des sources sonores contenues dans le mélange. Les sources identifiées sont localisées grâce à la matrice de mélange obtenue par ACI, pour fournir une cartographie de la scène sonore. Une étude exhaustive des performances est menée sur des contenus réels en fonction de plusieurs paramètres : nombre de sources, environnement acoustique, longueur des trames, ou ordre ambisonique utilisé. Des résultats fiables en terme de localisation et de comptage de sources ont été obtenus pour des trames de quelques centaines de ms. L’algorithme, exploité comme prétraitement dans un prototype d’assistant vocal domestique, permet d’améliorer significativement les performances de reconnaissance, notamment en prise de son lointaine et en présence de sources interférentes.},

Second, HOA provides tools to record, or create, and render a spatial sound scene. These tools, which rely on a speciﬁc encoding and decoding of spatial information, will be analysed and discussed from a both theoretical and practical point of view.

	isbn = {978-3-319-42209-1},
	abstract = {This book presents the signal processing algorithms that have been developed to process the signals acquired by a spherical microphone array. Spherical microphone arrays can be used to capture the sound field in three dimensions and have received significant interest from researchers and audio engineers. Algorithms for spherical array processing are different to corresponding algorithms already known in the literature of linear and planar arrays because the spherical geometry can be exploited to great beneficial effect. The authors aim to advance the field of spherical array processing by helping those new to the field to study it efficiently and from a single source, as well as by offering a way for more experienced researchers and engineers to consolidate their understanding, adding either or both of breadth and depth. The level of the presentation corresponds to graduate studies at MSc and PhD level. This book begins with a presentation of some of the essential mathematical and physical theory relevant to spherical microphone arrays, and of an acoustic impulse response simulation method, which can be used to comprehensively evaluate spherical array processing algorithms in reverberant environments. The chapter on acoustic parameter estimation describes the way in which useful descriptions of acoustic scenes can be parameterized, and the signal processing algorithms that can be used to estimate the parameter values using spherical microphone arrays. Subsequent chapters exploit these parameters including in particular measures of direction-of-arrival and of diffuseness of a sound field. The array processing algorithms are then classified into two main classes, each described in a separate chapter. These are signal-dependent and signal-independent beamforming algorithms. Although signal-dependent beamforming algorithms are in theory able to provide better performance compared to the signal-independent algorithms, they are currently rarely used in practice. The main reason for this is that the statistical information required by these algorithms is difficult to estimate. In a subsequent chapter it is shown how the estimated acoustic parameters can be used in the design of signal-dependent beamforming algorithms. This final step closes, at least in part, the gap between theory and practice.},

This representation has a potential both as a valuable tool for directly analyzing sound multipath propagation, as well as being a new spatial feature format for machine learning algorithms in audio and acoustics. As a showcase, we demonstrate that the Directionof-Arrival and the range of a sound source can be estimated as a development of this approach.

In noisy and reverberant environments, the source localization problem becomes challenging and many existing algorithms deteriorate. Three-dimensional source localization presents advantages for certain applications such as beamforming, where we can steer a beam to both the desired azimuth and the desired elevation. In this paper, we present an acoustic source localization method with low computational complexity which, instead of using individual microphone signals, combines them to form eigenbeams. We then use the zero-and first-order eigenbeams to compute a pseudointensity vector pointing in the direction of the sound source. In an experimental study, the proposed method's localization accuracy is compared with that of a steered response power localization method, which uses the same eigenbeams. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has higher localization accuracy.},
